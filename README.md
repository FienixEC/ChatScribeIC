## Overview

_NOTE:_

This documentation was last updated for version **1.2.0**.

Please go to
[github](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/ChatScribe)
for the most up-to-date documentation.

You can also download this plugin from this [page](https://github.com/alejandroliu/pocketmine-plugins/releases/tag/ChatScribe-1.2.0).

Let's you log all commands and chat's to files.

**To ensure user's privacy, there is a set of regular expressions that
will remove passwords before logging the line.  You can add additional
regular expressions if needed.**

Usage:

* /log [on|off]
  * with no arguments shows logging status
  * on : enables logging
  * off : disables logging
* /spy [start|stop|ls] [player]
  * logs what a player is doing in-game.  Useful to help noobs.

Users with the permission **chatscribe.privacy** do not have their
commands logged.

The following command lines are modified before logging so passwords
are **NEVER** stored:

* SimpleAuth related:
  * /login
  * /register
  * /unregister
* SimpleAuthHelper:
  * /chpwd

### Configuration

Configuration is through the `config.yml` file.
The following sections are defined:

#### main

*  log: Either server or file
*  dest: output destination. If log is file, this is a filename, otherwise emergency|alert|critical|error|warning|notice|info|debug
*  default: If true, will start logging by default
*  spy: Allow logging in-game
*  privacy: regular expressions and replacements used for ensuring privacy
*  warning: Text to show warning that logging is available


### Permission Nodes

* chatscribe.cmd : Enable logging
  (Defaults to Op)
* chatscribe.privacy : No logging
  _(Defaults to disabled)_
* chatscribe.spy : Allow to spy on users in-game
  _(Defaults to disabled)_


## Output Destinations

The **dest** setting in the **config.yml** file depends on the **log**
log type.

If **log** set to **server** **dest** can  be one of the following:

* emergency
* alert
* critical
* error
* warning
* notice
* info
* debug

Essentially this is included in the **server.log** and the lines will
be tagged with that prefix.  Whereas on the console, these different levels are color coded differently.  The only special tag is **debug**.
These are not show unless you enable debug logs in **pocketmine.yml**.

If **log** is set to **file** **dest** is set to a filename that will be
created in the default PocketMine location (usually the same folder as
**server.log**) but you can specify a full path if needed.

## Changes

  * Added a warning that logging is available
* 1.0.1:

  * Removed the early/later listener option
* 1.0.0: First release
